/*
Rameshâ€™s house is located at a junction from which the places of his four friends 
are located at two coordinate points each. 
He must be at either one of their houses at the same time. 
Help him choose which house to go to by finding out the one 
with the nearest distance from his place. The coordinates of their 
houses are as follows: 
                Name	              Coordinates
              Ramesh	                  (3,2)
              Friend A	                  (2,3)
              Friend B	                  (0,0) 
              Friend C	                  (5,8)
              Friend D	                  (1,4)
